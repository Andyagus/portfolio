NASA: First Woman was the second project I had the opportunity to work on at Bully Entertainment. Our team took on the project in close partnership with the team at NASA with the goal of exciting the next generation of space explorers!

Since the app launched, over 467 million people from 70 different countries interacted with our project. In 2022, our team won the Webby and Peoples Choice Awards for Best Integrated Mobile Experience, and, we were featured in Apple's App Store to celebrate Women's History Month. The project, initially scoped as a single experience, is still being developed today with new graphic novel issues being released, continuous app updates, and even a First Woman Camp Experience!
