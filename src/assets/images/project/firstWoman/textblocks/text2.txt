The project is based around an original story about Callie Rodriguez, the first female astronaut and person of color to set foot on the moon— And it was set in a beautifully detailed and illustrated graphic novel – which worked in conjunction with the Native iOS App - in order to bring static imagery to life through AR Objects - and Immersive Environments. This excited the user to learn about NASA technology, and making one feel as if they are in space.My role as the UX Designer, extended to being part of the overall strategy , and taking part in most meetings with Derek Wang, the director of communications at NASA, to discuss the teams designs and progress with the overall app.
