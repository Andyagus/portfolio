Overall the project was an amazing success, which was a result of the hard work of the entire team. The project continues to live on through more Graphic Novels, and in app content, as I write this the 3rd Novel is in development!

For me the most exciting part of the project was being able to communicate with the NASA team and share the teams work on the designs, and also whitness the workflow across the entire Bully team from concept to development - understanding the potential of Unity.

Looking back at it one of my regrets in the project was diving to deep into the UI while working on the UX, and also adding to many different features to the UX, (many of which were added) instead of focusing further on the aspects that were most important. But there is always next time! I am proud to have been involved on this project and I am excited to see where it continues to develop in the future!
